##Music Classification Project

Music Genre Classification is one of the many branches of Music Information Retrieval. From here you can perform other tasks on musical data like beat tracking, music generation, recommender systems, track separation and instrument recognition etc. Music analysis is a diverse field and also an interesting one. A music session somehow represents a moment for the user. Finding these moments and describing them is an interesting challenge in the field of Data Science.
